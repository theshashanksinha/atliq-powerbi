# Project Title: AtliQ Grands Market Revitalization

## Overview
This project spearheaded the revival of AtliQ Grand's Luxury/Business Hotel sector, leveraging strategic Data Analysis and Visualization. Utilizing Power BI and Excel, I meticulously analyzed Historical Data from multiple Five-Star Hotels in India, examining a Dataset of over 130,000 Entries to discern Market Trends, Booking Patterns, and Guest Preferences. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) revealed:

* Total Revenue Generated: INR 2 Billion.
* Average Length of Stay: 2.37 Days.

Translating Complex Data into Actionable Insights, I developed Interactive Power BI Dashboards, empowering Stakeholders with Decision-Making Tools. The Project refined Skills in Data Analysis, Visualization, and Stakeholder Communication, showcasing my ability to drive Impactful Outcomes through Data-Driven Insights for AtliQ Grands.
